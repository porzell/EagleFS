# EagleFS
A small, lightweight file system suitable for use by microcontrollers for flash memory storage devices.

## Features
  - Unlimited file size support.

## Features TO-DO:
  - C-compliant FILE I/O headers with added write insertion capabilities (State: In progress)
  - FS redesign to support unlimited number of directories and unlimited number of files in directories (State: Almost there)
  - Basic file permissions (State: In progress)
  - Basic block-buffering to avoid write wear on limited write cycle storage devices (State: Not yet started)

## Future TO-DOs:
  - Read/Write optimization (less fragmented design)
  - Data Integrity, Security, and Encryption features


## Bugs:
  - Path parsing needs to be tweaked in some instances with shorter paths.
